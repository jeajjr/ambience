{"name":"Ambience","tagline":"The room ambient controller","body":"## The Ambience Project\r\n\r\nAmbience is a room environment controller.\r\n\r\nThe project mainly intends to create a LED light controller, with the user interface\r\nbeing a smartphone application. Project evolution includes automation of power\r\noutlets, which may be used to control fans, heaters and other utilities.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nThe project contains three parts with their respective repositories:\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/jeajjr/ambience/raw/master/images/diagram.png)\r\n\r\n1. [Android application](https://github.com/jeajjr/ambience-android)\r\n2. [Hardware project](https://github.com/jeajjr/ambience-hardware)\r\n3. [ESP8266 python application](https://github.com/jeajjr/ambience-python)\r\n\r\n### Functionalities\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation allows to choose color and light intensity for the RGB LED\r\nstrip.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\nFuture functionalities include:\r\n\r\n- Set up timers for turning the light on and off\r\n- Add external relay board control on Android and python applications\r\n- Implement some method of authentication should be implemented to avoid agents \r\nother than the Ambience Android application to send commands.","note":"Don't delete this file!
